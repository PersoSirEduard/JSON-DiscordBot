what the f*ck happened to you.
rhyming is hard, f*ck you.
you were adopted, nobody loves you.
that's the color on your face, when I'm done with you.
if you were lucky, you wouldn't be you.
I thought I was ugly until I saw you.
if I had a brick, I would throw it at you.
sugar is sweet and so are you, but the roses are willing, the violets are dead, the sugar bowls empty and so is your head.
